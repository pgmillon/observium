        "A value used to index per-VLAN tables: values of 0 and
        4095 are not permitted; if the value is between 1 and
        4094 inclusive, it represents an IEEE 802.1Q VLAN-ID with
        global scope within a given bridged domain (see VlanId
        textual convention).  If the value is greater than 4095
        then it represents a VLAN with scope local to the
        particular agent, i.e. one without a global VLAN-ID
        assigned to it. Such VLANs are outside the scope of
        IEEE 802.1Q but it is convenient to be able to manage them
        in the same way using this MIB."

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight
        ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through
        8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc.
        Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
        the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
        represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port
        of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the
        value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1'
        then that port is included in the set of ports; the port
        is not included if its bit has a value of '0'."

BridgeId ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS  current
     DESCRIPTION
           "The Bridge-Identifier as used in the
           Spanning Tree
           Protocol to uniquely identify a bridge.  Its first two
           octets (in network byte order) contain a priority
           value and its last 6 octets contain the MAC address
           used to refer to a bridge in a unique fashion
           (typically, the numerically smallest MAC address
           of all ports on the bridge).
           Several objects in this MIB module represent values of
           timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.  In this
           MIB, these timers have values in units of hundreths of
           a second (i.e. 1/100 secs).
           These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's
           BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however,
           that 802.1D-1990 specifies a settable granularity of
           no more than 1 second for these timers.  To avoid
           ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual
           convention and all representation of these timers
           in this MIB module are defined using this data type.  An
           algorithm is also defined for converting between the
           different units, to ensure a timer's value is not                                  distorted by multiple conversions."

 OwnerString ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS current
     DESCRIPTION
         "This data type is used to model an administratively
         assigned name of the owner of a resource. Implementations
         must accept values composed of well-formed NVT ASCII
         sequences. In addition, implementations should accept
         values composed of well-formed UTF-8 sequences.

         It is suggested that this name contain one or more of
         the following: IP address, management station name,
         network manager's name, location, or phone number.
         In some cases the agent itself will be the owner of
         an entry.  In these cases, this string shall be set
         to a string starting with 'monitor'.

         SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms
         of the contents of MIB views; access to a particular
         SNMP object instance depends only upon its presence
         or absence in a particular MIB view and never upon
         its value or the value of related object instances.
         Thus, objects of this type afford resolution of
         resource contention only among cooperating
         managers; they realize no access control function
         with respect to uncooperative parties."

 RmonStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS current
     DESCRIPTION
         "The status of a table entry.

         Setting this object to the value invalid(4) has the
         effect of invalidating the corresponding entry.
         That is, it effectively disassociates the mapping
         identified with said entry.
         It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether
         the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
         Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to
         receive tabular information from agents that corresponds
         to entries currently not in use.  Proper
         interpretation of such entries requires examination
         of the relevant RmonStatus object.

         An existing instance of this object cannot be set to
         createRequest(2).  This object may only be set to
         createRequest(2) when this instance is created.  When
         this object is created, the agent may wish to create
         supplemental object instances with default values
         to complete a conceptual row in this table.  Because the

         creation of these default objects is entirely at the option
         of the agent, the manager must not assume that any will be
         created, but may make use of any that are created.
         Immediately after completing the create operation, the agent
         must set this object to underCreation(3).

         When in the underCreation(3) state, an entry is allowed to
         exist in a possibly incomplete, possibly inconsistent state,
         usually to allow it to be modified in multiple PDUs.  When in
         this state, an entry is not fully active.
         Entries shall exist in the underCreation(3) state until
         the management station is finished configuring the entry
         and sets this object to valid(1) or aborts, setting this
         object to invalid(4).  If the agent determines that an
         entry has been in the underCreation(3) state for an
         abnormally long time, it may decide that the management
         station has crashed.  If the agent makes this decision,
         it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the
         entry.  A prudent agent will understand that the
         management station may need to wait for human input
         and will allow for that possibility in its
         determination of this abnormally long period.

         An entry in the valid(1) state is fully configured and
         consistent and fully represents the configuration or
         operation such a row is intended to represent.  For
         example, it could be a statistical function that is
         configured and active, or a filter that is available
         in the list of filters processed by the packet capture
         process.

         A manager is restricted to changing the state of an entry in
         the following ways:

              To:       valid  createRequest  underCreation  invalid
         From:
         valid             OK             NO             OK       OK
         createRequest    N/A            N/A            N/A      N/A
         underCreation     OK             NO             OK       OK
         invalid           NO             NO             NO       OK
         nonExistent       NO             OK             NO       OK

         In the table above, it is not applicable to move the state
         from the createRequest state to any other state because the
         manager will never find the variable in that state.  The
         nonExistent state is not a value of the enumeration, rather
         it means that the entryStatus variable does not exist at all.

         An agent may allow an entryStatus variable to change state in
         additional ways, so long as the semantics of the states are
         followed.  This allowance is made to ease the implementation of
         the agent and is made despite the fact that managers should
         never exercise these additional state transitions."

                 appropriately configured, the value of the
                 corresponding instance of the usmUserStatus column
                 is 'notReady'.

                 In particular, a newly created row for a user who
                 employs authentication, cannot be made active until the
                 corresponding usmUserCloneFrom and usmUserAuthKeyChange
                 have been set.

                 Further, a newly created row for a user who also
                 employs privacy, cannot be made active until the
                 usmUserPrivKeyChange has been set.

                 The RowStatus TC [RFC2579] requires that this
                 DESCRIPTION clause states under which circumstances
                 other objects in this row can be modified:

                         Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a

                         most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet

                         sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.
        
                         Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
                         the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when

                           the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th
                           sub-identifier of the value of
                           vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.
        
                         If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and
        
                         there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
                         corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,
                         then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the
                         required length.

 -- The History Control Group

 -- Implementation of the History Control group is optional.
 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative
 -- conformance information for this MIB.
 --
 -- The history control group controls the periodic statistical
 -- sampling of data from various types of networks.  The
 -- historyControlTable stores configuration entries that each
 -- define an interface, polling period, and other parameters.
 -- Once samples are taken, their data is stored in an entry
 -- in a media-specific table.  Each such entry defines one
 -- sample, and is associated with the historyControlEntry that
 -- caused the sample to be taken.  Each counter in the
 -- etherHistoryEntry counts the same event as its similarly-named
 -- counterpart in the etherStatsEntry, except that each value here
 -- is a cumulative sum during a sampling period.
 --
 -- If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start
 -- the first sample of the history at a time such that
 -- when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is
 -- started at that instant.  This tends to make more
 -- user-friendly reports, and enables comparison of reports
 -- from different probes that have relatively accurate time
 -- of day.
 --
 -- The probe is encouraged to add two history control entries
 -- per monitored interface upon initialization that describe a short
 -- term and a long term polling period.  Suggested parameters are 30
 -- seconds for the short term polling period and 30 minutes for
 -- the long term period.

 -- The Alarm Group

 -- Implementation of the Alarm group is optional. The Alarm Group
 -- requires the implementation of the Event group.
 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative
 -- conformance information for this MIB.
 --
 -- The Alarm group periodically takes statistical samples from
 -- variables in the probe and compares them to thresholds that have
 -- been configured.  The alarm table stores configuration
 -- entries that each define a variable, polling period, and
 -- threshold parameters.  If a sample is found to cross the
 -- threshold values, an event is generated.  Only variables that
 -- resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32,
 -- Counter32, Counter64, Gauge32, or TimeTicks) may be monitored in
 -- this way.
 --

 -- This function has a hysteresis mechanism to limit the generation
 -- of events.  This mechanism generates one event as a threshold
 -- is crossed in the appropriate direction.  No more events are
 -- generated for that threshold until the opposite threshold is
 -- crossed.
 --
 -- In the case of a sampling a deltaValue, a probe may implement
 -- this mechanism with more precision if it takes a delta sample
 -- twice per period, each time comparing the sum of the latest two
 -- samples to the threshold.  This allows the detection of threshold
 -- crossings that span the sampling boundary.  Note that this does
 -- not require any special configuration of the threshold value.
 -- It is suggested that probes implement this more precise algorithm.

 -- The Event Group

 -- Implementation of the Event group is optional.
 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative
 -- conformance information for this MIB.
 --
 -- The Event group controls the generation and notification
 -- of events from this device.  Each entry in the eventTable
 -- describes the parameters of the event that can be triggered.
 -- Each event entry is fired by an associated condition located
 -- elsewhere in the MIB.  An event entry may also be associated
 -- with a function elsewhere in the MIB that will be executed
 -- when the event is generated.  For example, a channel may
 -- be turned on or off by the firing of an event.
 --
 -- Each eventEntry may optionally specify that a log entry
 -- be created on its behalf whenever the event occurs.
 -- Each entry may also specify that notification should
 -- occur by way of SNMP trap messages.  In this case, the
 -- community for the trap message is given in the associated
 -- eventCommunity object.  The enterprise and specific trap
 -- fields of the trap are determined by the condition that
 -- triggered the event.  Two traps are defined: risingAlarm and
 -- fallingAlarm.  If the eventTable is triggered by a condition
 -- specified elsewhere, the enterprise and specific trap fields
 -- must be specified for traps generated for that condition.
