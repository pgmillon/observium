        then it represents a VLAN with scope local to the
        particular agent, i.e. one without a global VLAN-ID
        assigned to it. Such VLANs are outside the scope of
        IEEE 802.1Q but it is convenient to be able to manage them
        in the same way using this MIB."

    DESCRIPTION
        "Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight

        8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc.
        Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
        the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
        represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port
        of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the
        value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1'
        then that port is included in the set of ports; the port
        is not included if its bit has a value of '0'."

BridgeId ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS  current
     DESCRIPTION
           "The Bridge-Identifier as used in the
           Spanning Tree
           Protocol to uniquely identify a bridge.  Its first two
           octets (in network byte order) contain a priority
           value and its last 6 octets contain the MAC address
           used to refer to a bridge in a unique fashion
           (typically, the numerically smallest MAC address
           of all ports on the bridge).
           Several objects in this MIB module represent values of
           timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.  In this
           MIB, these timers have values in units of hundreths of
           a second (i.e. 1/100 secs).
           These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's
           BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however,
           that 802.1D-1990 specifies a settable granularity of
           no more than 1 second for these timers.  To avoid
           ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual
           convention and all representation of these timers
           in this MIB module are defined using this data type.  An
           algorithm is also defined for converting between the
           different units, to ensure a timer's value is not                                  distorted by multiple conversions."

 RmonStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS current
     DESCRIPTION
         "The status of a table entry.

         Setting this object to the value invalid(4) has the
         effect of invalidating the corresponding entry.
         That is, it effectively disassociates the mapping
         identified with said entry.
         It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether
         the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
         Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to
         receive tabular information from agents that corresponds
         to entries currently not in use.  Proper
         interpretation of such entries requires examination
         of the relevant RmonStatus object.

         An existing instance of this object cannot be set to
         createRequest(2).  This object may only be set to
         createRequest(2) when this instance is created.  When
         this object is created, the agent may wish to create
         supplemental object instances with default values
         to complete a conceptual row in this table.  Because the

         creation of these default objects is entirely at the option
         of the agent, the manager must not assume that any will be
         created, but may make use of any that are created.
         Immediately after completing the create operation, the agent
         must set this object to underCreation(3).

         When in the underCreation(3) state, an entry is allowed to
         exist in a possibly incomplete, possibly inconsistent state,
         usually to allow it to be modified in multiple PDUs.  When in
         this state, an entry is not fully active.
         Entries shall exist in the underCreation(3) state until
         the management station is finished configuring the entry
         and sets this object to valid(1) or aborts, setting this
         object to invalid(4).  If the agent determines that an
         entry has been in the underCreation(3) state for an
         abnormally long time, it may decide that the management
         station has crashed.  If the agent makes this decision,
         it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the
         entry.  A prudent agent will understand that the
         management station may need to wait for human input
         and will allow for that possibility in its
         determination of this abnormally long period.

         An entry in the valid(1) state is fully configured and
         consistent and fully represents the configuration or
         operation such a row is intended to represent.  For
         example, it could be a statistical function that is
         configured and active, or a filter that is available
         in the list of filters processed by the packet capture
         process.

         A manager is restricted to changing the state of an entry in
         the following ways:

              To:       valid  createRequest  underCreation  invalid
         From:
         valid             OK             NO             OK       OK
         createRequest    N/A            N/A            N/A      N/A
         underCreation     OK             NO             OK       OK
         invalid           NO             NO             NO       OK
         nonExistent       NO             OK             NO       OK

         In the table above, it is not applicable to move the state
         from the createRequest state to any other state because the
         manager will never find the variable in that state.  The
         nonExistent state is not a value of the enumeration, rather
         it means that the entryStatus variable does not exist at all.

         An agent may allow an entryStatus variable to change state in
         additional ways, so long as the semantics of the states are
         followed.  This allowance is made to ease the implementation of
         the agent and is made despite the fact that managers should
         never exercise these additional state transitions."

                valid(1),

                 If a set operation tries to change the value of an


                 existing instance of this object to any value other

                 If a set operation tries to set the value to the
                 NoAuthProtocol while the UserPrivProtocol value
                 in the same row is not equal to NoPrivProtocol,
                 then an 'inconsistentValue' error must be returned.
                 That means that an SNMP command generator application
                 must first ensure that the UserPrivProtocol is set
                 to the NoPrivProtocol value before it can set
                 the UserAuthProtocol value to NoAuthProtocol.

                         Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
                         the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when

                           vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree.

                         If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and

                         there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
                         corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,

 -- The History Control Group

 -- Implementation of the History Control group is optional.
 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative
 -- conformance information for this MIB.
 --
 -- The history control group controls the periodic statistical
 -- sampling of data from various types of networks.  The
 -- historyControlTable stores configuration entries that each
 -- define an interface, polling period, and other parameters.
 -- Once samples are taken, their data is stored in an entry
 -- in a media-specific table.  Each such entry defines one
 -- sample, and is associated with the historyControlEntry that
 -- caused the sample to be taken.  Each counter in the
 -- etherHistoryEntry counts the same event as its similarly-named
 -- counterpart in the etherStatsEntry, except that each value here
 -- is a cumulative sum during a sampling period.
 --
 -- If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start
 -- the first sample of the history at a time such that
 -- when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is
 -- started at that instant.  This tends to make more
 -- user-friendly reports, and enables comparison of reports
 -- from different probes that have relatively accurate time
 -- of day.
 --
 -- The probe is encouraged to add two history control entries
 -- per monitored interface upon initialization that describe a short
 -- term and a long term polling period.  Suggested parameters are 30

 -- The Alarm Group

 -- Implementation of the Alarm group is optional. The Alarm Group
 -- requires the implementation of the Event group.
 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative
 -- conformance information for this MIB.
 --
 -- The Alarm group periodically takes statistical samples from
 -- variables in the probe and compares them to thresholds that have
 -- been configured.  The alarm table stores configuration
 -- entries that each define a variable, polling period, and
 -- threshold parameters.  If a sample is found to cross the
 -- threshold values, an event is generated.  Only variables that
 -- resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32,
 -- Counter32, Counter64, Gauge32, or TimeTicks) may be monitored in
 -- this way.
 --

 -- This function has a hysteresis mechanism to limit the generation
 -- of events.  This mechanism generates one event as a threshold
 -- is crossed in the appropriate direction.  No more events are
 -- generated for that threshold until the opposite threshold is
 -- crossed.
 --
 -- In the case of a sampling a deltaValue, a probe may implement
 -- this mechanism with more precision if it takes a delta sample
 -- twice per period, each time comparing the sum of the latest two
 -- samples to the threshold.  This allows the detection of threshold
 -- crossings that span the sampling boundary.  Note that this does
 -- not require any special configuration of the threshold value.
 -- It is suggested that probes implement this more precise algorithm.
